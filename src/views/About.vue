            <p>
              I am 13 years old. I play minecraft. I see a hype of servers on it
              and start, without understanding everything that is happening
              around, create my own servers and connect the client-server
              architecture on the CMS DLE and the launcher of this game, which
              is written in Java. Too many complexities in the intricacies of
              the frontend and backend (then I didn't know what it was yet) and
              I just repeat everything in foreign video tutorials. Later I
              realized that with my knowledge you can make a little money and I
              started unpacking clients of other minecraft servers and packing
              various cheats in them for sale to real people. Thug life in my
              13...

            <span>2017 -- Frontend or no way! ðŸ¤¡</span>
            <p>
              After a long break in programming, I go to university for
              Information Security and fall in love with C++. The university
              program in this language is very easy for me and I begin to study
              the possibilities of my development in its field. I understand
              that in this language in my country you will not go far but i
              continue to look for options: in my opinion, Python and JavaScript
              is awesome! I choose JavaScript and start learning HTML and CSS
              for coding interfaces.

          <li>
            <span>2018 -- F**k off, society ðŸ˜¢</span>
            <p>
              I still donâ€™t come close to JavaScript, but I already know HTML
              and CSS very well in order to make money and live away from my
              parents. One fine moment I quit my managerial position at work and
              on the same day I fly to an unfamiliar city, in which I have never
              been before. I was tired of almost everything in the world except
              for what I was really in love with - and that was Frontend. It was
              enough for me for two months (thanks to terrible overtime for 13
              hours a day, seven days a week on freelance) and I return back by
              the same plane.

            <span>2019 - NOWADAYS -- I'm in love with the... JS! ðŸ’»</span>
            <p>
              In 2019 I thoroughly studied
              <a target="_blank" href="https://javascript.info/"
                >learn.javascript</a
              >. I spent a year on vanilla and Typescript, occasionally using
              some kind of libraries, and then I started learning React.js and
              taking larger orders. I managed to work for a year in the office
              as a Front-end Developer and still grow in my career. I use React
              at work, Vue.js at home. At the moment I take orders for both
              React and Vue.js, but I prefer the second one.
